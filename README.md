# WCA Competition Orga

A small collection of helpers to plan my (first) WCA competition.

Reads in the public database, mainly to get to know the previous results of competitors, and matches the information with the .csv-table for this competition's attendees.

Cleaned jupyter notebook to ensure no sensitive information is displayed publicly.
